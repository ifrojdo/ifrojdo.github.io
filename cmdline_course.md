## Command-line Course 2021
During the Command-line tools for linguist course, or KIK-LG221, the aim has been to learn the basics of operating a Unix 
environment using command-line. This course is especially aimed at linguists as we learn how to handle text files and do text processing using command-line tools. In addition to this, the course also introduces the concept of working through remote servers using tools as SSH and Github.   


**The course structure**


Week | Content | Important commands 
--- | --- | ---
Week 1 | Introduction | `ls, pwd, whoami, cd, wget, mv, cp, rm, mkdir, emacs` 
Week 2 | Navigation | `Important commands` 
Week 3 | Basic Corpus Processing | `Important commands` 
Week 4 | Advanced Corpus Processing | `Important commands` 
Week 5 | Scripting and configuration Files | `Important commands`
Week 6 | Installing and running programmes | `Important commands` 
Week 7 | Version control using Github | `Important commands` 


### **Week 1:** Introduction to Command Line
The first week of this course focused on setting up and getting used to the Unix environment. 
We set up our own shells in the introduction week.
We used commands like `pwd`
and `ls` to see our current working directory and to list the items in it. 
Other learning goals were to know how to change directory (with `cd`),fetch files from the internet, rename copy and move files using `mv`and `cp`. Lastly we also touched upon opening text files using `emacs`. 
 
At the end of the week we were able to set up the dircetory in which we have been working for the rest of the course, namely KIK-219 (which I guess is another code for the same course?).
