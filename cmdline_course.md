## Command-line Course 2021
During the Command-line tools for linguist course, or KIK-LG221, the aim has been to learn the basics of operating a Unix 
environment using command-line. This course is especially aimed at linguists as we learn how to handle text files and do text processing using command-line tools. In addition to this, the course also introduces the concept of working through remote servers using tools as SSH and Github.   


**The course structure**


Week     | Content | Important commands 
--- | --- | ---
Week 1  | Introduction | `ls, pwd, whoami, cd, wget, mv, cp, rm, mkdir, emacs` 
Week 2  | Navigation | `ls -F`,`cp -R`, `rm -R`, `rmdir`, `which`, `chmod`, `ssh`, `scp`
Week 3  | Basic Corpus Processing | `file, dos2unix, iconv, tr, sort, uniq, head, tail, wc, tr, (e)grep` 
Week 4  | Advanced Corpus Processing | `Important commands` 
Week 5  | Scripting and configuration Files | `Important commands`
Week 6  | Installing and running programmes | `Important commands` 
Week 7  | Version control using Github | `Important commands` 


### **Week 1:** Introduction to Command Line
The first week of this course focused on setting up and getting used to the Unix environment. 
We set up our own shells in the introduction week.
We used commands like `pwd`
and `ls` to see our current working directory and to list the items in it. 
Other learning goals were to know how to change directory (with `cd`), fetch files from the internet `wget`, rename copy and move files using `mv`and `cp`. Lastly we also touched upon opening text files using `emacs`. 
 
At the end of the week we were able to set up the dircetory in which we have been working for the rest of the course, namely KIK-219 (which I guess is another code for the same course?).



### **Week 2:** Navigating Unix systems
The second week was split into three distinct parts: the unix system, processes, and remote servers. 
In the first part we looked at the structure of the unix systems with the root, directories and subdirectories and also how to copy, move and delete a directory and how to alter file permissions. Here we also touched upon how to compress and uncompress files using `gzip` and `tar`.
As for the process part, the main focus was how to initialice, identify, monitor and kill processes.
Lastly, in the third part we connected to a remote server using `ssh` and worked in remote terminals using `scp`.  



### **Week 3:** Basic Corpus Processing
The third consisted of learning how command-line can be used in text processing, with the first key lesson concerning encoding systems, such as ASCII and utf-8, and converting between these systems.
After the initial introduction we started working on text files using `wc`for word count, for example, `sort` for sorting lines into alphabetical order, and `tr`to make changes throughout the text file.   


### **Week 4:** Advanced Corpus Processing

### **Week 5:** Scripting and Configuration Files

### **Week 6:** Installing and Running Programmes

### **Week 7:** Version Control using Github
